A Rule Engine AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is a structured representation of rules that can be evaluated by a rule engine. It breaks down rules into their constituent parts (like expressions, conditions, and actions) in a tree format, making it easier to analyze, optimize, and execute them.

In a typical use case, the rule engine processes user-defined rules, converts them into an AST, and then evaluates these rules by traversing the tree. This approach allows for efficient execution and supports complex logic, including nested conditions, comparisons, and function calls.

Key benefits:

Performance: Optimized rule execution.
Flexibility: Allows handling dynamic and complex business logic.
Maintainability: Clear structure for debugging and modifications.

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

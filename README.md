# RULE-ENGINE
A Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a system designed to evaluate complex rules and conditions based on user attributes (e.g., age, department, salary, etc.). The AST structure allows the rule engine to represent and manipulate logical expressions dynamically, enabling efficient rule evaluation and modification.
